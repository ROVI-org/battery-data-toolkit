Battery Data Toolkit
====================

The battery-data-toolkit, ``batdata`` converts battery cycling data from native formats to a standardized HDF5 file.
These HDF5 files contain the metadata needed to understand the source of the data,
and can be easily manipulated by common analysis libraries (e.g., Pandas).
