class CapacityPerCycle(CycleSummarizer):
    """Compute the observed capacity and energy during both charge and discharge of each cycle

    Determines capacities based on the integral of current over each cycle:

    1. Compute the change in state of charge from the start of the cycle
       by computing the integral of the capacity over time.
       We refer to this integral as the dSOC.
    2. Determine whether the battery started from a charged state
       by determining if the largest capacity change is positive
       (i.e., if the point most different state of charge from the
       start is _more discharged_ than the starting point).
       The code will raise a warning if the quantities are similar.
    3. If starting from a charged state, the discharge capacity
       is the maximum change in state of charge (``dSOC.max()``).
       The charge capacity is the amount of charge transferred to the
       battery between this maximally-discharged state and the end
       the of the cycle (``dSOC.max() - dSOC[-1]``)
    4. If starting from a discharged state, the charge capacity
       is the maximum change in state of charge and the discharge capacity
       is the amount transferred from the battery into the end of the cycle.

    The energy is computed using a similar procedure, but by integrating
    the product of current and voltage instead of only current.

    .. note::

        Measurements of capacity and energy assume a cycle returns
        the battery to the same state as it started the cycle.
